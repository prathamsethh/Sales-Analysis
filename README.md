# Sales-Analysis
## Overview Of Project:
The aim of this project is to analyse the sales data of a XYZ co. for the period 2017-2020. This would help them in making informed decision for future based on previous data.
## Objectives:
- What are the sales by different categories over the years?
- What is the profit gained over time across different categories?
- What are the sales by states for each category over this period?
- How the customer count has changed over time?
- Who are the top 5 customers according to profit?
- What are the sales according to month?
## We have created a interactive dashboard in order to solve this problem.
